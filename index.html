    <p>This is a calendar page made by Laszlo Ladanyi and it features a painting by Ank Vlasblom, I just found these images in my folders and I became excited about sharing or somehow noting this idea.</p>

          <p>This is a tribute to something or someone. What is a tribute? I will look in the dictionary for a description. https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tribute 1. ‚ÄúA gift, payment, declaration, or other acknowledgment of gratitude, respect, or admiration: put up a plaque as a tribute to his generosity.‚Äù My ideas to do, a tribute to Masanobu Fukuoka, to Ornette Coleman, Miroco Machiko.</p>

          <p>The product landing page became a page to browse rocks. In the Artist's Way ther eis an exercise to collect five interesting or pretty rocks. So after collecting these rocks I made drawings and came up with the idea of making a webpage with the rocks.</p>

      <p>If I were to recall what I have learnet I would probably think of regular expressions and I would recommend reading Jeffrey Friedl's book on regular expressions. It serves me well writing algorithms. You can edit text with regular expressions and find words in text. \w is a regular expression term signifying alphanumerical characters.</p>

      <p>I was super happy for this last watercolor, because it has the sort of painterly feel I felt I was feelling for.</p>
