    <p>plain english</p>
    <p>I am currently reading <a href="https://clearest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Communicating-with-Older-People-PLC-Ed-3-A4-AS-PUBLISHED-.pdf">Communicating with
      Older People - Writing in plain English</a></p>
    <p>It would be cool to be able to write in plain English, and to improve my writing skills. This is a free book on writing clearly.</p>
    <p>Another book I am reading is Critical Thinking A Students Introduction</p>
    <p>In typography it is good to give 1.3 line height in the CSS file with line-height: 1.3; which I did - I learnt this at <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/">Butterick's Typography</a></p>
    <p>I forgot whether I already set 1.3 for this page and I wonder if</p>
    <h3 class="affirmation">this is good enough</h3>

          <p>This is a tribute to something or someone. What is a tribute? I will look in the dictionary for a description. https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tribute 1. ‚ÄúA gift, payment, declaration, or other acknowledgment of gratitude, respect, or admiration: put up a plaque as a tribute to his generosity.‚Äù My ideas to do, a tribute to Masanobu Fukuoka, to Ornette Coleman, Miroco Machiko.</p>

          <a class="linkToLanding" href="https://attilavajdaxyz.github.io/legendary-engine/pebbleshop/pebble.html"><h3 class="tlandingHeader">Product Landing Page</h3></a>
          <p>The product landing page became a page to browse rocks. In the Artist's Way ther eis an exercise to collect five interesting or pretty rocks. So after collecting these rocks I made drawings and came up with the idea of making a webpage with the rocks.</p>

  <h1>Now I have a portfolio of paintings! Oh yes. üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
  <p>and a blog also</p>

      <p>It is responsive, because I am using @media in the CSS file, it is also accessible, because I wrote an alt="" message into the img tags.</p>

      <p>If I were to recall what I have learnet I would probably think of regular expressions and I would recommend reading Jeffrey Friedl's book on regular expressions. It serves me well writing algorithms. You can edit text with regular expressions and find words in text. \w is a regular expression term signifying alphanumerical characters.</p>

      <p>I was super happy for this last watercolor, because it has the sort of painterly feel I felt I was feelling for.</p>
