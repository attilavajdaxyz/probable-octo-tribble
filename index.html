          <p class="responsiveDescription"><i>the following projects are from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a></i></p>
          <p class="thoughts">I took these projects as design briefs and further developed them. Please click on the headers to open the webpages. ü´ê</p>

          <a class="linkToTribute" href="https://codepen.io/attila_vajda/pen/eYGwqNO"><h3 class="tributeHeader">Tribute page</h3></a>
          <p>This is a tribute to something or someone. What is a tribute? I will look in the dictionary for a description. https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tribute 1. ‚ÄúA gift, payment, declaration, or other acknowledgment of gratitude, respect, or admiration: put up a plaque as a tribute to his generosity.‚Äù My ideas to do, a tribute to Masanobu Fukuoka, to Ornette Coleman, Miroco Machiko.</p>

          <!--    Product Landing Page    -->
          <a class="linkToLanding" href="https://codepen.io/attila_vajda/pen/QWqeYXd?editors=1000"><h3 class="tlandingHeader">Product Landing Page</h3></a>
          <p>The product landing page became a page to browse rocks. In the Artist's Way ther eis an exercise to collect five interesting or pretty rocks. So after collecting these rocks I made drawings and came up with the idea of making a webpage with the rocks.</p>

  <h1>Now I have a portfolio of paintings! Oh yes. üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
  <p>and a blog also</p>

      <p>It is responsive, because I am using @media in the CSS file, it is also accessible, because I wrote an alt="" message into the img tags.</p>

      <p>If I were to recall what I have learnet I would probably think of regular expressions and I would recommend reading Jeffrey Friedl's book on regular expressions. It serves me well writing algorithms. You can edit text with regular expressions and find words in text. \w is a regular expression term signifying alphanumerical characters.</p>

      <p>I was super happy for this last watercolor, because it has the sort of painterly feel I felt I was feelling for.</p>
